## Overview

The AGIcam Dashboard provides real-time monitoring and historical data access for 18 camera sensors deployed in wheat breeding trials. Built with HTML5 and Bootstrap 5, it offers:

- **Real-time NDVI monitoring** via embedded Grafana dashboards
- **Historical image galleries** from field-deployed cameras  
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile access
