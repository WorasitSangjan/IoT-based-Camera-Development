## Overview

AGIcam is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) camera system designed for automated in-field phenotyping and yield prediction. Developed at Washington State University's Phenomics Lab, this platform enables continuous, high-frequency monitoring essential for capturing rapid phenological transitions and dynamic crop responses in breeding programs.

### Key Features

- **Solar-Powered Autonomy**: 6W solar panel with 6,400 mAh battery for season-long operation
- **Wireless Connectivity**: 4G LTE and Wi-Fi for real-time data transmission
- **Dual Camera System**: Synchronized RGB and NoIR imaging (3x daily capture-Adjustable depend on User's requirement)
- **Edge Computing**: On-device vegetation index calculation for 7 VIs
- **Cloud Integration with MING Stack**: Automated data transfer from Node-RED MQTT to InfluxDB with Grafana visualization
- **Low Cost**: $150-200 per sensor unit

## System Architecture

*Figure 2: System architecture of the AGIcam platform, illustrating its core components*

The AGIcam platform consists of four main components:

1. **[Hardware Development](1_Camera_Development/)** - Physical sensor design and 3D enclosures
2. **[Backend System](2_Backend_System/)** - Node-RED data pipeline and cloud integration  
3. **[Web Dashboard](3_AGIcam_Dashboard/)** - Real-time monitoring interface
4. **[Data Analysis](4_Data_Analysis/)** - Machine learning models for yield prediction

## Performance Highlights

### Field Deployment Results (2022 Season)
- **18 sensors** deployed across spring and winter wheat trials
- **85%+ uptime** maintained throughout the growing season
- **Sub-daily monitoring** with 3 imaging sessions per day
- **7 vegetation indices** computed in real-time

### Yield Prediction Accuracy
| Crop Type | Model | RMSE (kg/ha) | Error Rate |
|-----------|-------|--------------|------------|
